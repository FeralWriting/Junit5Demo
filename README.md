# JUnit5Demo

## Overview

Practice making and running tests using JUnit 5. This project acted as a refresher for JUnit, OOP, and TQA.

## Features

This project includes a rudimentary "Cup" class to be tested. The object includes variables for the type of liquid and how full the cup is, as well as getters and setters.

The tests evaluate the getters and setters to determine if they store the correct values in the variables. All of the tests evaluate correctly.
